### Instagram: the hosting half is built, and §8 rewritten from measurements

R2 bucket `overlay-reels` created (WNAM, Standard — the free tier does not cover Infrequent
Access). `r2creds.py` holds the S3 credentials in the Keychain, clipboard-driven, adapted from
the homelab script. `r2.py` uploads, presigns and deletes with **SigV4 written in stdlib**.

🛑 Hand-rolling request signing is normally wrong. The reason it is defensible here is that
**a signing bug fails loudly** — a wrong signature is a 403, never a wrong-but-accepted
result. That is the inverse of the failure class this repo keeps hitting. boto3 was rejected
on three grounds: ~50 MB of botocore for three operations, a `requirements.txt` that justifies
every line, and a venv in the main checkout that other sessions share.

⚠ **The selftest was checked for the ways it could pass for free**, not just run. The decisive
probe: an unsigned GET of the object returns **HTTP 400**, so the bucket is not public — which
is what makes a successful presigned GET evidence of anything. With a public bucket the test
would pass with a completely broken signer. Wrong secret → 403, wrong key id → 401, presign
expired 2 s ago → 403, tampered key → 403.

Real-size round trip, 16.7 MB: PUT 2.1 s, presigned GET 0.8 s byte-exact, `video/mp4`, exact
length, DELETE 204. **Range request → 206**, which had to work because Meta probes with
partial requests before pulling the file.

### Corrections to what §8 previously claimed

- **"Sources disagree on whether Creator works or it must be Business"** — they don't. Both
  work; only Personal accounts are excluded. The club account is already Professional.
- **A Facebook Page is not required.** Meta has two configurations and only *Facebook Login
  for Business* needs a linked Page. **Instagram API with Instagram Login** supports content
  publishing with no Page, scope `instagram_business_content_publish`.
- The app must be created as type **Business** — the docs state a non-Business app has to be
  recreated, so choosing wrong costs a rebuild.

### 🛑 Two new tripwires

- **A long-lived Instagram token dies at 60 days and then cannot be refreshed at all.** Using
  it does not extend it; only an explicit `refresh_access_token` call does. The off-season is
  the hazard — a gap over 60 days kills it silently and costs the whole app flow again, where
  YouTube's equivalent trap only costs a browser round trip.
- **Instagram has no private-first option.** The YouTube model of upload-private-then-flip has
  no equivalent, so `--confirm` is load-bearing and publishing stays manual-trigger only.

### The reel crop is left open — no default shape at all

`--aspect-bat` and `--aspect-bowl` now have **no defaults**. Omit a role's flag and that role is
cut at full frame, which `publish.py` correctly refuses as a Short instead of letting a
landscape file land as an ordinary video. Pass a comma list and one file per shape is cut, each
with its own caption sidecar, so several can be compared on screen and `--meta` still pairs with
whichever survives review. [highlights.md](./highlights.md) §13a.

Two reasons the shape cannot be a constant, and picking one would have been a false economy:
the camera framing changes every match and nothing in the file reveals where the pitch sits,
and the two roles need different boxes anyway — a batting crop must hold **both** sets of stumps
because the batter's end alternates, while a bowling crop needs the run-up behind them.

The measured spans for the reference camera stay in the docs, but as a measurement of *that*
camera rather than as a recommendation; `crop.py` re-derives them per match.


### The reel crop is a per-match input, and the two roles crop differently

The camera framing changes every match, so the crop cannot be a constant — and batting and
bowling do not want the same box anyway:

| Reel | Must contain | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **batting** | **both** sets of stumps — 🛑 the batter's end alternates every over and on every odd run, so one end loses half their shots. The run-up is irrelevant. | `4:5` |
| **bowling** | the stumps **and the run-up**, which starts behind them | `1:1` |

`--aspect-bat`, `--aspect-bowl`, `--crop-x-bat`, `--crop-x-bowl` set them independently, and new
`crop.py` draws the candidates on a real frame with their spans printed, so a match's values can
be read off the picture in a minute. [highlights.md](./highlights.md) §13a.

### 🛑 One player, two roles, two reels — an all-rounder was getting one broken reel

Reels are now keyed by **(player, role)** with the role in the filename. Keyed by name alone, a
player who hit a four and later took a wicket got a single reel holding both, and every caption
helper reads the role off the first moment — so it would have been captioned with batting
figures while containing a wicket. It also made a per-role crop impossible to apply.

⚠ **Nothing in the fixture could have caught this**: it has one innings and two events sharing a
striker and a bowler, so no player ever appears in both roles. It was found by asking what the
per-role crop should do for a player who does both, not by a failing test. Now pinned by
`test_an_all_rounder_gets_one_reel_per_role`.


### 🛑 Reels crop square, not 9:16 — the old crop cut the pitch in half

`--vertical` produced a 9:16 centre column. On this camera that is **geometrically incapable**
of holding the action: the camera is side-on, the pitch runs across the frame occupying about
36%–73% of the width, and a 9:16 window at 16:9 is only **31.6%** wide. Checked against three
real events in the reference match, it cut off the bowler's end every time — including the
batter at the far stumps on the wicket. A 1:1 crop is 56.2% wide and holds the whole pitch.
[highlights.md](./highlights.md) §13a.

🛑 **The old value was never a decision.** It was ffmpeg's `crop` centring default, and the
justification written in these docs — that it removes the `?data=1` block — is a side effect of
*any* crop starting past ~4% of the width, not a reason to pick that shape. I documented a
coincidence as a rationale, and it stood until someone asked how the crop was chosen.

❌ **Motion-based auto-crop was tried and rejected.** A per-column temporal standard-deviation
map per clip, the same technique `find_bar()` uses to locate the overlay, put the peak at 81.6%,
39.2% and 75.8% on the three events. Those are not the batter: across a 20-second window the
bowler's run-up and the fielders chasing outweigh a shot lasting a fraction of a second. It
found the bowler's end on one clip and the striker's on another — not consistently wrong, just
uninformative. Recorded as a negative result so it is not re-attempted.

⚠ There is no fixed action side to aim at anyway: the striker's end alternates every over and
again on every odd run. Square sidesteps the question rather than answering it per ball.

Shorts accept height ≥ width, so square still uploads as a Short — confirmed through
`shorts_problems()` and a real 1080x1080 encode. `--aspect` and `--crop-x` remain for a
different camera setup.


### Captions read like a scorecard line

`reels.py` captions were `V. Kohli — 1 six`, which used almost nothing the payload carries.
They now read as cricket: `V. Kohli 46 (28) — 2 sixes, 1 four`, or `J. Bumrah 3/24 (4.0 ov)`
for a bowling reel, with a stamped commentary line per ball giving the over and the score.
[highlights.md](./highlights.md) §13c.

Four decisions in there worth keeping:

- `figures()` reads the player's **highest** figures across every state, not the ones on their
  last boundary. ⚠ Otherwise a batter whose final four came at 20 but who finished on 60 is
  captioned "20".
- 🛑 **The headline is the innings; "In this reel" is what was captured.** They differ whenever
  the stream started late, so both are named rather than leaving one looking wrong.
- ⚠ Zero counts are omitted — the first real run produced `1x4, 0x6`, which reads like a bug.
- ⚠ A bowling title drops its wicket count only when it equals the innings figure; a smaller
  number means the reel holds part of the spell, which is worth saying.

Two of those were only visible by running it on the real recording rather than on the unit
tests, which is why the fixture output is checked by eye as well as asserted.

### Pre-match checklist

[highlights.md](./highlights.md) §14. The pipeline is ready, but 🛑 **a match streamed without
`?data=1` can never have per-player reels** — no code in the pixels means no names, and nothing
recovers attribution after the fact. That is now a CLAUDE.md tripwire, because it is one query
parameter standing between a match and all of its reels.

⚠ Still unexercised on real footage: several players, both innings, real names, and
`qrscan.py`'s runtime on a 4-hour 4K file.


### Per-player reels (`reels.py`)

One vertical reel per player for a single team: their boundaries when the team bats, their
wickets when it fields. This was the original goal of the whole highlights pipeline and the
thing §8's abandoned ball-strip reader could not support. [highlights.md](./highlights.md) §13.

Three decisions worth keeping:

- 🛑 **`--batting-innings` is required, not inferred.** The payload has no team identity, only
  an innings number. Guessing it inverts every attribution, so it is a required argument and
  `test_reels.py` pins the inversion.
- ⚠ **A run-out belongs to no bowler.** `qrscan.moments()` now emits `bowlerWicket`, true only
  when the bowler's own figure moved, so another fielder's dismissal cannot land in a bowler's
  reel. It defaults true for older scans rather than dropping their wickets.
- 🛑 **Attribution fails silently**, unlike a clip window. A wrong window visibly misses the
  shot; a wrong attribution yields a good clip filed under the wrong person. Hence 19 unit
  tests on the rules and none on the ffmpeg call.

✅ `--vertical` removes the `?data=1` block for free — verified by re-scanning a finished reel:
**0 of 80** keyframes decoded, against 13 of 13 on the source.

Captions travel in a sidecar (`--meta`), because a reel spanning several balls has no single
moment to caption it from.

### 🛑 httplib2 breaks multi-chunk resumable uploads, and a small fixture hides it

The first real reel, 20.7 MB, failed instantly with
`RedirectMissingLocation: Redirected but the response is missing a Location: header`. Google
answers each accepted chunk with **308 Resume Incomplete**; httplib2 0.32 counts 308 as a
redirect and tries to follow it, but a Resume Incomplete carries no `Location`.
`http.follow_redirects = False` fixes it — [publishing.md](./publishing.md) §4c.

⚠ **The lesson is the fixture, not the flag.** The earlier lock test used a 0.7 MB clip, under
the 8 MB chunk size, so it went up in one request and never touched the chunked path. It passed
clean and proved less than it appeared to. A fixture smaller than the chunk size does not
exercise a chunked upload at all — the same shape as the four harness faults in
[highlights.md](./highlights.md) §7b, and the third time this session that a green result came
from an instrument that could not fail.

Also removed a stale dry-run warning still telling the operator their uploads would be locked
private.


### 🛑 The upload lock was never real here, and I never tested it

`publish.py --privacy public --confirm` uploaded through this project's **own unverified** OAuth
client. The video landed **Public**, played in a signed-out incognito window, and its visibility
could still be changed. A locked video fails all three. Recorded in
[publishing.md](./publishing.md) §0.

**The premise most of this session was built on was an untested assumption.** Google does
document that unverified projects get their uploads locked private — that part is real — but the
earlier attempt died at the OAuth consent wall (§3a) before any upload completed, and I wrote the
restriction up as a settled 🛑 tripwire anyway. Everything downstream followed from it:

- a Make.com account, a scenario, a webhook and a Keychain entry pair
- a costed Cloudflare R2 hosting plan, to get past a 5 MB limit
- a recommendation to apply for Google's compliance audit
- two wrong claims about that 5 MB limit, corrected separately the same evening

None of it was needed. The measurement was ten minutes and one throwaway clip, and it should have
come before the tripwire, not after the workaround. `--metadata-only` stays as the fallback, but
it is no longer the useful mode.

⚠ **The Make result is weaker than I presented it.** It was framed as proof that an audited
project escapes the lock. With the direct API behaving identically, that experiment had no
control: the outcome is equally consistent with "the lock does not bite here at all". §5 now says
so, and the route is demoted to a fallback.

### 🛑 httplib2 ignores the system trust store and both CA environment variables

The test was blocked first by TLS, not by YouTube. `googleapiclient` talks through **httplib2**,
which uses the bundle inside `certifi` and reads neither `SSL_CERT_FILE` nor
`REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` — so behind Zscaler every API call failed with "unable to get local issuer
certificate" **after** the OAuth consent had succeeded and written a token, because that leg goes
through `requests`, which does honour `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`.

A valid credential plus a failing transport reads exactly like a bad credential. `ca_bundle()`
and `authorized_http()` now hand the bundle to httplib2 explicitly. This is a *different* fault
from the `VERIFY_X509_STRICT` one already recorded — same proxy, unrelated fixes, distinguishable
only by the error text. [publishing.md](./publishing.md) §4b.

Also fixed while there: the success line printed
`https://youtube.com/shortsMO3YZtBHz1c` — a missing slash — and followed it with a 🛑 warning
that the video was probably locked, which was both wrong and alarming.


### The locked-private blocker is solved: upload through Make's audited project

`publish.py --post-to` posts a clip and its captions to a Make.com custom webhook, which feeds
`YouTube › Upload a Video`. Tested end to end: the video landed **Public**, as a Short, with an
**empty Notices panel** in Studio — so the §0 lock, which attaches to the calling API project
rather than to the channel, does not apply to this route. Recorded in
[publishing.md](./publishing.md) §5.

This matters because §0 had made the uploader mostly pointless: our own unverified project can
only produce videos YouTube locks private and will not unlock on appeal. `--metadata-only` was
the honest fallback. It no longer has to be.

Two things the test corrected about my own work:

- ⚠ **`--post-to` returned before the `--confirm` gate**, so it uploaded with no confirmation —
  breaking the one invariant §1 states outright ("nothing uploads without `--confirm`"). The
  safety default existed and the new code path simply walked around it. Now gated.
- ⚠ **`--privacy` is not honoured on this route** and nothing said so. The Make module sets
  Privacy Status statically, so the POSTed field is ignored; the dry-run output printed
  `privacy private` next to an upload that would land public. It now warns on every run.

And one measurement trap worth keeping: **`oembed` answered 401 throughout, for both URL forms,
while the video loaded fine in a signed-out incognito window.** Read on its own that looks
exactly like a locked video, and I nearly wrote it up first as the lock and then as propagation
lag. It was neither — oEmbed just does not resolve fresh Shorts. The controls (known-public →
200, nonexistent id → 400) proved the instrument ran; they could not tell me it was the wrong
instrument. A signed-out page load is what settled it. Fifth entry in the same family as the
four harness faults in [highlights.md](./highlights.md) §7b.

⚠ **The 5 MB ceiling is worse than first recorded, and the workaround I proposed was wrong.**
It is not a webhook limit and it is not "every tier": it is a **plan-level cap on any file a
scenario handles**, 5 MB only on the free plan, rising to Core 100 MB / Pro 250 MB / Teams
500 MB / Enterprise 1 GB. So hosting a reel on R2 and having Make fetch it by URL hits the same
wall — the R2 work I had queued as "the remaining step" would not have helped. A ~20 MB reel
needs the **Core** tier. The test clip was 0.68 MB, which is why nothing surfaced this.


### Knowledge moved into an OKF v0.2 bundle

`docs/` is now an Open Knowledge Format bundle — `okf-base.yaml` at the root, index at
`docs/index.md`, validated with `okflint validate --manifest okf-base.yaml`. Same shape as the
homelab repo.

The reasoning was spread across four files that each had a different job. `README.md` is the
public usage guide and had accumulated traps and rationale; `architecture.md` was almost entirely
knowledge; `CLAUDE.md` mixed ground rules with domain detail; `highlights/README.md` had become a
200-line design document sitting inside a tool directory.

Converted into six concepts: `overlay.md`, `data-code.md`, `highlights.md`, `analytics.md`,
`deployment.md`, `feature-ideas.md`. `architecture.md` was **absorbed and deleted** — its
project-structure tree and data-flow diagram are the parts worth keeping and they moved into
`overlay.md`. `feature-ideas.md` moved from the root into the bundle. `CLAUDE.md` is now ground
rules, an address index and one-line tripwires only.

Two things the conversion surfaced, both stale claims that had been sitting in `README.md`:

- It told people to point OBS at a "deployed GitHub Pages URL". GitHub Pages was dropped in
  PR #9 in favour of Netlify.
- It said pushes to `main` touching `worker/**` deploy automatically "once a
  `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` repository secret exists", stated as a fact. The workflow does exist but
  skips itself, and **not adding that secret is a deliberate decision** — the opposite of what a
  reader would have concluded.

`CLAUDE.md` also pointed at `docs/cricclubs-api.md`, which exists only on the
`feature/cricclubs-views` branch. The index links it and flags it as arriving with PR 13; OKF
permits broken links, since they mark knowledge not yet written rather than an error.

### The `?data=1` machine-readable code shipped

The overlay now draws a QR code carrying the whole bar state, so `highlights/` reads events
instead of inferring them from card colours. `?data=1`, off by default.

Sized down from 148 px to **66 px** over the day by measuring rather than assuming: the quiet
zone from 4 modules to 2, and the module from 4 px to 2 px. Both floors were then confirmed by
pushing past them — a 0-module quiet zone fails outright, and 1 px modules manage one good frame
in twelve because the compositing upscale leaves them with no unblended centre.

Verified on two real IRL Pro captures from the match rig: **55 of 55** sampled frames byte-exact
with the CRC passing, on both the 148 px and the 66 px geometry, at 14.96 and 13.89 Mb/s.

### Four harness faults, and what they cost

Every QR measurement taken before these were found had been wrong, in both directions:

- `cv2.QRCodeDetector` was scoring **detection** as **decoding**. It returns a str and mangles
  arbitrary bytes — 0 of 60 random payloads recovered byte-exactly from *perfect* images, while
  reporting success every time. zxing-cpp recovers 60 of 60 and is now pinned with that reasoning
  in `requirements.txt`, because the next person will reach for cv2.
- The Python `qrcode` library inflates binary payloads: 42 random bytes became a **v14** code,
  73 modules instead of 29. Benches must use the same npm encoder the overlay ships.
- An early bench held the code still for a whole clip, so h264 propagated it losslessly from the
  I-frame and everything passed.
- 2-level mode had inverted polarity, which looked like a codec failure rather than a bug.

The pattern is the lesson: each fault was found by deliberately pushing until something broke,
never by reading a green result. Recorded in `highlights.md` §7b.

### The audio data channel was tested and ruled out

An audio channel would have beaten pixels outright — nothing to crop, and SMPTE LTC already
standardises data on an audio track with 32 free user bits per frame. Measured crosstalk through
the recording's own AAC-LC at 95 kbit/s was only +0.3 dB, so a data channel would have been
cleanly strippable.

It needed one thing to be true, and it isn't: **IRL Pro does not capture browser-source audio.**
A probe page emitting 1000 Hz left, 3000 Hz right and a 220 Hz tick, recorded on the real rig,
showed the phone playing the tone through its loudspeaker and the microphone hearing it — 59 ms
reverb tail against the 8 ms envelope it was generated with, channel separation collapsed to
4 dB at 3 kHz, and mic AGC ducking the broadband level 25 dB when the tone began. Corroborated by
Softvelum staff on the WebView component: *"The corresponding component does not provide audio
source for our app."*

So LTC, ggwave and every other modem are moot regardless of merit. The same recording confirmed
what mattered: browser-source **video** composites correctly.

### A boundary off a no-ball was invisible

A six off a no-ball arrives as `7nb`, not `6`, and `detectEvents()` exact-matched `'4'` and
`'6'` — so no card fired, the disc was coloured as a plain no-ball, and the shot never reached a
reel. `runsOffBat()` now parses runs off the bat, accepting both scoring conventions since
scorers differ on whether they include the penalty.

The same trap reappeared in a different disguise in the QR event rules: `ballsBowled` counts
legal balls, so a no-ball does not advance it and a new delivery has to be recognised from the
runs or the wickets instead.

### `strip.py` abandoned and deleted

Reading the overlay's ball-by-ball strip directly would have removed the dependency on catching
a 2-second card. It cannot work: the strip's x position moves across the match, so a single
calibration is wrong by construction, and light discs are nearly invisible against the card. The
disc finder itself was correct; the grid assumption was what failed. The QR code solved the
underlying problem properly. Kept in `highlights.md` §8 so it is not attempted again.
