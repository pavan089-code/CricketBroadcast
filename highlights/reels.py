"""Per-player reels for ONE team: their boundaries when batting, their wickets when bowling.

A personal reel should only contain balls that belong to that player, and which player a
ball belongs to depends on which side of it our team was on:

    our team batting   ->  a four or a six belongs to the STRIKER
    our team fielding  ->  a wicket belongs to the BOWLER

🛑 The payload carries no team identity — only an innings number (see docs/data-code.md
§2), because team names would have cost more bits than the whole rest of the record. So
which innings our team batted has to be told to this tool with --batting-innings. There is
no way to infer it from a recording, and guessing it inverts every attribution: our
batters' boundaries would be credited to the opposition and vice versa.

⚠ A wicket is only credited to the bowler when their OWN figure moved. A run-out raises
the team wicket count while `bowlerWickets` stays put, and crediting that to the bowler
would put another fielder's dismissal in their reel. `qrscan.moments()` carries the
`bowlerWicket` flag for exactly this.

🛑 There is no default crop. The camera framing changes every match and the two roles want
different boxes, so the shape is reviewed per match rather than baked in. Omit a role's
flag to leave it at full frame; pass a list to cut one file per shape and choose after
watching them. `crop.py` draws the candidates on a real frame first.

Usage:
    .venv/bin/python reels.py "<video>" events.json -o reels/ \\
        --batting-innings 1 --team "Topguns" --match "Topguns vs Bazzigarz" \\
        --aspect-bat 4:5,1:1 --aspect-bowl 1:1
