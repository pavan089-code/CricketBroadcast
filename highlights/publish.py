"""Upload a reel or a highlights video to YouTube.

Two targets, one endpoint. YouTube has no Shorts-specific API: `videos.insert` is the only
upload call, and YouTube decides a video is a Short from the file itself — vertical, and short.
So the only thing that separates `--target shorts` from `--target video` here is the metadata
and the validation, which is exactly why the validation matters: upload a 16:9 file expecting a
Short and you silently get an ordinary video on the channel.

Quota is not a constraint. `videos.insert` has its own bucket with a 100-call daily limit,
separate from the 10,000-unit project pool, so a match's worth of reels plus the full video is
nowhere near it.

🛑 AN UNVERIFIED API PROJECT CANNOT PUBLISH PUBLICLY. Every video uploaded through
videos.insert from an unverified project created after 28 July 2020 is LOCKED as private by
YouTube, and that lock cannot be appealed — the only remedy is to re-upload through a verified
client or by hand. So until the project passes a compliance audit, --confirm gets the file onto
the channel but it can never be made public. Use --metadata-only in the meantime: it writes the
generated title and description for a manual upload, which is the part worth automating anyway.

SAFETY. This publishes to a channel under someone's name, so two things are deliberate: uploads
default to `private` visibility, and nothing is sent without `--confirm`. Without it the tool
prints exactly what it would do and exits 0.

🛑 Secrets never live in this repo — it is public. They go in the macOS Keychain, the same
place the homelab repo keeps its tokens. See docs/publishing.md.
