"""Read the overlay's `?data=1` QR code out of a recording.

This replaces inferring events from the picture. Colour-stripe detection (detect.py) can
only see an event while its card is on screen, and `app.ts` dismisses a card the moment the
score changes — a wicket followed quickly by the next ball can be up for under two seconds
and fall between keyframes, which is how the first pass on the Bazzigarz match found 13 of
the 15 wickets. The code is in every frame, so nothing depends on catching a transient.

It also carries far more than a card does: both player names, both batters' scores, the
bowler's figures, the partnership, and an exact ball outcome that distinguishes a six off a
no-ball from a plain no-ball. Events are therefore derived from what *changed* between two
payloads rather than from what happened to be drawn.

Decoding uses zxing-cpp, not OpenCV. cv2.QRCodeDetector returns a str and mangles arbitrary
bytes: it recovered 0 of 60 random 42-byte payloads byte-exactly even from perfect
uncompressed images, while reporting a successful detection every time. See requirements.txt.

Verified on two real IRL Pro captures from the match rig (3840x2160 at 14.96 and 13.89
Mb/s): 55 of 55 sampled frames in each decoded byte-exact with the CRC passing.
